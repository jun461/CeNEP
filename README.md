# CeNEP
A general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for cementitious materials！
The CeNEPv1.0.zip package contains the interatomic potentials, DFT datasets, and models that support the development of CeNEP.
The CeNEP_fine-tuning potential is a pre-release version provided to the research community for exploratory use and was not included in the paper “CeNEP: A General-Purpose Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Cementitious Materials.”
Data and models are publicly and freely available for academic research purposes.
