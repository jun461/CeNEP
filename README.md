# CeNEP
A general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for cementitious materials！
This model was developed by graduate students Fengzijun Pan, Guangyao Li, and Jiaqiu Xu under the supervision of Dr. Zepeng Fan
The CeNEPv1.0.zip package contains the interatomic potentials, DFT datasets, and models that support the development of CeNEP.
The CeNEP_fine-tuning potential is a pre-release version provided to the research community for exploratory use and was not included in the paper “CeNEP: A General-Purpose Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Cementitious Materials.”
Data and models are publicly and freely available for academic research purposes.
